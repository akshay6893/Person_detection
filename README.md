# Person_detection

This file detects objects from 81 classes which includes individual faces,bottles ect.It's just a custom dataset i chose.
You can choose any number of classes.
Since this was done with my non gpu pc it detects frames every 2. seconds without a gpu.
It can be easily scales up with Tensor RT inference server to performe inference on a gpu,
with good Throughput.
